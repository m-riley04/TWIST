# Issues and PRs
Many (if not most) softawre engineering environments utilize a ticketing system to keep track of progress and keep a steady flow of project work. This project utilizes GitHub's built-in "[Issues](https://github.com/m-riley04/TWIST/issues)" section as this sort of ticketing system, combined with a project in the GitHub "[Projects](https://github.com/m-riley04/TWIST/projects?query=is%3Aopen)" section to keep track of the ticket Agile workflow.

The Kanban project can be found [here](https://github.com/users/m-riley04/projects/11).

Each issue should have an associated PR and branch attached to it. The branch should be titled "T-#", where # is the issue id.
